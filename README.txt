On the top, right hand side of the board there are five drop-down menus: Language, Type of contact, Template,
Company and FPI (i.e. full protection insurance). Note that this version of the program does not contain 
all the templates for security reasons.  To search for available templates:



-  Select “Spanish” in the language menu

-  Select “Outbound” in the Type of contact menu

-  Choose at will any available option in the remaining menus

-  Click “Search”

Populate gaps in the template

After searching successfully for a template, the program will highlight various cells 
within the section “Fields" to the left of the drop-down menus. Adding the information required by the coloured cells 
allows the program to replace the tags in the template and fill it in with customers’ personal information. After 
adding the requested information click on "finalize template" and then on “Copy email body” 



All available templates for this version are stored in a pivot table in Sheet2 (hidden)
